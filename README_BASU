Modifications to regular libSVM 3.11 library:

eval.h, eval.cpp added to help optimize over criteria other than accuracy.

In eval.cpp,

	double (*validation_function)(const dvec_t&, const ivec_t&) = auc;
	controls the optimization criteria. Options are:
	--accuracy
	--auc
	--bac
	--recall
	--precision
	--fscore
Have to recompile libSVM each time this is changed. 

In svm-predict.c, 

	#include "eval.h" is added.

	In main(),
		-->predict(input,output); is replaced by --> binary_class_predict(input, output);

In svm-train.c, 

	#include "eval.h" is added.

	In main(),
	
		-->do_cross_validation(); is replaced by,
		-->double cv =  binary_class_cross_validation(&prob, &param, nr_fold);
			printf("Cross Validation = %g%%\n",100.0*cv);

	To change the seed value for Cross Validation for multiple iterations,

	#include <time.h> is added.
	In main(), srand(time(0)); is added.

In grid.py,

	accuracy is replaced by auc in the display.
